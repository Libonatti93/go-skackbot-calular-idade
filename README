Slack Age Calculator Bot
Set up the App in Slack:

Go to the Slack API and create a new app.
Add permissions to the bot, such as chat:write and commands.
Set up a "Bot User" and a "Slash Command" (e.g. /age).
Get the bot token (starts with xoxb-) and add it to your environment as an environment variable or directly in the code (not recommended for production).
Install Dependencies:

Install the Slack for Golang package:
go get github.com/slack-go/slack


Code Explanation
Slackbot Configuration: The main function configures an HTTP server that handles Slack events.
Verification Token: Uses Slack verification tokens to ensure that requests are valid.
Slash /age Command: The bot responds to the Slack /age command with a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Age Calculation: The calculateAge function calculates the age based on the date of birth provided by the user.

Configuration and Execution
Environment Variables:

SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: The Slack bot token (xoxb-...).
SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN: The Slack verification token for command validation.
Running the Bot:

Compile the code with go build -o slackbot main.go.
Run the bot with ./slackbot.

Expose the Bot Locally:

Use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server to Slack:
ngrok http 3000

Update your Slash Command URL in Slack with the URL provided by ngrok (e.g. https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/slack/events).
Test in Slack:

Use the command /age 1990-05-20 to see the bot respond with the corresponding age.
